## Introduction
In this assignment, you will complete the PerimeterAssignmentRunner class to calculate lots of interesting facts about shapes. This class has been started for you in the BlueJ project called PerimeterAssignmentRunner (this is the same project file that you were using in the last exercise, so feel free to open it up again and continue working). The goals for this exercise are as follows:

1. (a) Complete writing the method getLargestSide that has one parameter s that is of type Shape. This method returns a number of type double that is the longest side in the Shape S.

1. (b) Add code in the method testPerimeter to call the method getLargestSide and to print out the result.

2. (a) Complete writing the method getLargestX that has one parameter s that is of type Shape. This method returns a number of type double that is the largest x value over all the points in the Shape s.

2. (b) Add code in the method testPerimeter to call the method getLargestX and to print out the result. Note if you were to select the file example1.txt, then the largest x value should be 4.0.

## Discussion

### Complete the getLargestSide method and output the results
For this section, we've got to complete the getLargestSide method, which we know has a parameter s, of type shape. We learned in the last assignment and readings about how to show what kinds of parameters a method has, so make sure to reference that if you're having trouble remembering how to get started. On paper, we're simply trying to compare the length of all of the sides of shape s, and report the largest side. This tells us that we'll need to be able to find the length of a side of a shape, but thankfully we already know how to do that from the other methods we've written and the Shape Class documentation (Hint: the length of a side of a shape is the distance between two points of the shape). 

Additionally, we know that we need to compare all of the sides of the shape, which implies we will need to iterate through each side of the shape to find its length. An important thing to remember when you're thinking about programming, is what your objective requirements are. In this case, we're only trying to find what the longest side is, so we only need to know if any given side is the longest side. We know how to calculate the length of a side, we know how to iterate through each point in a shape, we know how to keep a running tally while iterating, and we know how to compare values (if this is giving you trouble, revisit the video on conditionals). From here, it's simply putting it all together.  

As always, when you're done writing your code in the getLargestSide method, remember to add the code to call the getLargestSide method in the testPerimeter method and add the code to have the system print the output (the same way we did in the last exercise). As always, this is a great time to compile and test your code, and if you run this code using example1.txt as your shape file, then the longest side should be 5.0.

### Complete the getLargestX method and output the results
Once again, for this section we know how to show what type of parameter a method has, and in this case we know that the getLargestX method will be outputting a double-type variable, so that's a great place to start. From here, we know we'll need to find the largest X value of any given point in shape S, so we'll need to iterate through the points of the shape s and compare their x components (Hint: If you're having trouble finding the x component of a point, make sure to check the Point class documentation in the course site). From here out, we know how to iterate through all the points in a shape, compare their values, and keep track of the largest value. 

As always in these activities, call your getLargestX method in the testPerimeter method, and have the system output the results. If you run this section of code with example1.txt, the Largest X will be 4.0. 

This is where we'll leave off with this exercise, but you'll want to make sure you save all of your project files, as we'll be using the exact same project files for the next few activities.
