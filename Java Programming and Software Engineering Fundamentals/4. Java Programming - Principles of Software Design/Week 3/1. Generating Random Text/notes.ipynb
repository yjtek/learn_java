    "- Interfaces and Abstract classes\n",
    "    - Notice how in exercise 1, we created MarkovZero, MarkovOne, MarkovFour etc\n",
    "    - This is very troublesome. For every value you want to feed into markov, you have to write a new object\n",

    "    - By convention, interface names start with `I` (e.g. IMarkovModel)\n",

    "- For methods that use specific instances of MarkovOne/MarkovTwo etc, we instead change the type reference to the interface\n",

    "- Design principle: Open-closed\n",
    "    - Open for extension, closed to modification\n",

    "- Also notice that each class MarkovOne, MarkovFour etc have their own random number generator and text `myRandom`, `myText`\n",

    "    - These attributes are `protected`, not private. That is, they can be accessed outside of the ABC, so long as the subclass trying to access it is derived from the same ABC\n",
    "    - When marking a class as `Abstract`, it must accept an abstract function\n",
    "        - This means that the function signature will be defined in the Abstract class, but the actual implementation will be left to the individual instances of the ABC\n",
    "    - We can also have `protected` methods that are common to all subclasses\n",
    "        - In this case, the `getFollows(key)` method will be common!\n",
